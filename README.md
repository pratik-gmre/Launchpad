# Vibe - AI-Powered SaaS Website Builder

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

Vibe is an AI-powered SaaS app builder that lets you generate full-stack Next.js applications from simple prompts using programmable AI agents. The project features live previews, AI-driven code generation, authentication, billing, and a modern developer toolchain.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

npm run dev

or
yarn dev

or
pnpm dev

or
bun dev


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
